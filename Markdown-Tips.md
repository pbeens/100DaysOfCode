# Markdown Tips

1. The first line should always be a level-1 ('#') heading containing the title of the document. The title does not have to be the same as the filename.
1. There must always be a blank line at the end of the document.
1. Each line cannot have any trailing spaces.
1. VS Code has some excellent extensions that help with Markdown:
    1. [Paste URL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kukushi.pasteurl) is fantastic for pasting in links to websites. If you don't have any text highlighted when you paste the URL (using Ctrl-Alt-P) then the extension will automatically grab the title of the page and apply the link to it. What a time-saver! If you do have some text highlighted when you paste in the URL it will simply apply the URL to the highlighted text using the appropriate syntax.
    1. [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) can be used to check for errors in your Markdown.
    1. [MarkDown Link Suggestions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TomasHubelbauer.vscode-markdown-link-suggestions) is fantastic for entering links to other documents.
