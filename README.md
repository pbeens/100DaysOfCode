## The Rules

There are two primary rules:

1. Code a minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) hashtag.

Truthfully, I don't think I'll be able to follow rule #1 (although I'll do my best), but rule #2 should be pretty easy to follow.

This [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/), which is linked to from above on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org), has some additional rules, including:

3. Coding at work can't count towards your time.
4. Your daily code should be pushed to GitHub. (The creator's proposed GitHub template can be [forked](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) from [here](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code).)
5. Time spent on tutorials does not count. Only time spent working on challenges counts.

I'll be breaking rule #5, as I feel that learning (and coding) from video tutorials or books is still quite beneficial.

The template also mentions these additional rules which I will be following:

6. Follow the [_100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) which retweets all tweets with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. 
7. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!

Rule #7 will be an important one for me, as I'm developing a presentation on #100DaysOfCode where I will promoting the importance of the social benefits of this project.

In addition, I am adding this rule at least for myself, and I would encourage others to do the same:

8. Write down your goals for this project! 

The goals will of course vary over time, but at least it give me a direction to head in.

## My Goals

1. This project isn't supposed to be about the tools you use to code, but I've wanted to learn Visual Studio Code for long time so I am going to do my best to use it exclusively for this project. In addition, I will document (and share) the beneficial things I learn about it.
1. Again, about the tools... I will document everything using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Any tips I learn about Markdown will be document [here](Markdown-Tips.md).
1. I will likely concentrate on Python, although [Javascript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode%20%23javascript&src=typed_query) has quite a following amongst the #100DaysOfCode crowd.
1. I have purchased a 6 month subscription to [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com) which offers programing challenges. I will likely start with that.
1. More to come...

## Daily Log

* [Day 1](Days/01/)<br>I will start with the 'Add" challenge from Python Morsels.
