# 100DaysOfCode

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is based on the standards developed at [www.100daysofcode.com](https://www.100daysofcode.com).

This repository will be used document my progress with this project.

## The Rules

There are two primary rules:

1. Code a minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100daysofcode) hashtag.

Truthfully, I don't think I'll be able to follow rule #1 (although I'll do my best), but rule #2 should be pretty easy to follow.

This [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/), which is linked to from above on [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org), has some additional rules, including:

3. Coding at work can't count towards your time.
4. Your daily code should be pushed to GitHub. (The creator's proposed GitHub template can be [forked](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) from [here](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code).)
5. Time spent on tutorials does not count. Only time spent working on challenges counts.

I'll be breaking rule #5, as I feel that learning (and coding) from video tutorials or books is still quite beneficial.

The template also mentions these additional rules which I will be following:

6. Follow the [100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) which retweets all tweets with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. 
7. Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!

Rule #7 will be an important one for me, as I'm developing a presentation on #100DaysOfCode where I will promoting the importance of the social benefits of this project.

In addition, I am adding this rule at least for myself, and I would encourage others to do the same:

8. Write down your goals for this project! (see below)

The goals will of course vary over time, but at least it give me a direction to head in.

## My Goals

1. This project isn't supposed to be about the tools you use to code, but I've wanted to learn Visual Studio Code for long time so I am going to do my best to use it exclusively for this project. In addition, I will document (and share) the beneficial things I learn about it.
1. Again, about the tools... I will document everything using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Any tips I learn about Markdown will be documented [here](Markdown-Tips.md).
1. I will also be sharing via my blogs (mostly [beens](https://www.beens.ca).ca and [beens.ca/python](https://www.beens.ca/python/)), which is something that I have seriously neglected lately.
1. I will likely concentrate on Python, although [Javascript](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode%20%23javascript&src=typed_query) has quite a following amongst the #100DaysOfCode crowd.
1. I will try to learn and adhere to Python's style guide, called '[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)'.
1. I have purchased a 6 month subscription to [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com) which offers programing challenges. I will likely start with that.
1. I will share what I learned for each activity.
1. I will compile a list of [useful links](Links.md) that benefited me throughout this project.
1. I will keep track of my [more successful social media interactions](Social-Media\README.md) related to this project. 
1. Explore how Projects work within GitHub.
1. Do challenges from various sites, such as:
    1. [Python Morsels -- write better Python code](https://www.pythonmorsels.com)
    1. [codechalleng.es](https://codechalleng.es/bites/1/)
    1. [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net/)
    1. [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/)
    1. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
    1. [talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course)
    1. (See also [The 10 most popular coding challenge websites for 2017](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-10-most-popular-coding-challenge-websites-of-2016-fb8a5672d22f/))
1. Learn about PySimpleGUI.
1. I noticed in another #100DaysOfCode participant's [source code](https://github.com/harunaadoga/100daysofcode/blob/master/fileReadWrite.py) that he's using a library called `shelve` as part of his file I/O. I'd like to investigate this.
1. [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) looks very cool for app development. This is a lower priority that I might not get to in the 100 days of this challenge.
1. More to come...

## Daily Log

### Day 1-Day 2 - Add Matrices

I will start with the 'Add" challenge from [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com):

> Write a function that accepts two lists-of-lists of numbers and returns one list-of-lists with each of the corresponding numbers in the two given lists-of-lists added together.

[[Link](Days/01-02/)]

### Day 2 - Bonus for Day 1 Challenge

This is a bonus session for the [Day 1](Days/01-02/) challenge. I basically have to adapt the function so it works with _n_ sets of lists (instead of just two) in a list.

> For the first bonus, modify your add function to accept and "add" any number of lists-of-lists. Example: ```add([[1, 9], [7, 3]], [[5, -4], [3, 3]], [[2, 3], [-3, 1]])``` returns ```[[8, 8], [7, 7]]```

### Day 3 - GitHub Projects - Day 1 Challenge Bonus - List Comprehension

I spent some time today learning about GitHub Projects, which might be beneficial for this (#100DaysOfCode) and other projects I'm working on. Videos watched:

- [GitHub Project Management Tutorial - How To Use GitHub Projects & Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff5cBkPg-bQ)
- [Github Project Management 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXEy6CFu9Hk)

I poked away a little at the day 1 challenge bonus but it's turning out the be......a challenge! I've decided I wanted to learn more about list comprehension before I continue with this.

I spent quite a bit of time on a Python notebook I created to learn about list comprehension.

### Day 4 - Create Bio Page - More List Comprehension

#### List Comprehension

I am learning to get the hang of list comprehension. You just have to remember the basic format, which is:

```python
s = data_to_manipulate
[c for c in s if c equals or doesn't equal something]
```

View my updated Jupyter notebook of exercises [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fbmH9yDS5fzFcxEZMnUzmb3qCqGQoaEv#scrollTo=2jpxdgBu3rqc).

#### GitHub Pages

I learned that if you create a GitHub repository named `<username>.github.io` and put your content in the main [README.md](https://github.com/pbeens/pbeens.github.io/blob/master/README.md) file then it becomes the website at that URL.

See mine [here](https://pbeens.github.io/)!

#### Other Learning

I learned that Markdown doesn't like anything other than alphanumeric characters and hyphens in the headers if you want to create a table of contents. All of these were a no-go: `, | &`

### Day 5 - CSS - Blog CSS - Auto-formatting Python in VS Code - More List Comprehension

### Blog CSS

My CSS knowledge is very limited. Fortunately there are lots of great resources available to help when needed.

### Auto-formatting Python in VS Code

These are the settings I changed to get VS Code to auto-format my Python code:

```
"editor.formatOnSave": true`
"python.formatting.provider": "autopep8"
```

### List Comprehension

I came across this great animation that is perfect for demonstrating how list comprehensions are assembled:

<br>[[Credit](https://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/)]

This site helped me tremendously with flattening and recreating matrices:

- [Python List Comprehensions: Explained Visually - Trey Hunner](https://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/)

This site helped me add the individual elements of each list:

- [Nested list comprehension with two lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16568056/nested-list-comprehension-with-two-lists)

With these resources I was able to make great progress on my Day 2 challenge but it's not quite perfect yet. It will add matrices with sub-lists of len=2 but not others. I'll work on that next day...

View my updated Jupyter notebook of exercises [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fbmH9yDS5fzFcxEZMnUzmb3qCqGQoaEv). See the Resource 2 section for the code applicable to what I did today.

View my Python code for the Day 2 challenge here in the Day 2 folder. Remember, as of today, it's incomplete.
