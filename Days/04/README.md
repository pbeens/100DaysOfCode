# Day 4

I want to continue list comprehension exercises. My goal is to learn enough about list comprehension to efficiently finish the coding for day 2.

I also got interested yesterday in someone's GitHub.io biography which made me want to learn how to do that.

## My Approach

To find more resources with exercises and to come up with exercises on my own. I will expand on the existing [Python notebook](..\03\list_comp.ipynb) I created in day 3.

To find (and follow) a resource related to creating pages on githib.io (AKA GitHub pages) and adapt my [existing bio](https://peter.beens.ca/) to it.

## Solution

I successfully followed the directions here:

- [Creating a GitHub Pages site - GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site)

...to create my new GitHub.io bio page at [https://pbeens.github.io](https://pbeens.github.io/).

*More forthcoming...*

## What I Learned

I learned that if you create a GitHub repository named `<username>.github.io` and put your content in the main README.md file that it becomes the website at that URL. 

See mine [here](https://pbeens.github.io/)!

*More forthcoming...*

## Consider

Any links to add to [Links.md](..\..\Links.md)? (delete this section afterwards)
