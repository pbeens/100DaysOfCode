# Day 4

I want to continue list comprehension exercises. My goal is to learn enough about list comprehension to efficiently finish the coding for day 2.

I also got interested yesterday in someone's GitHub.io biography which made me want to learn how to do that.

## My Approach

### List Comprehension

To find more resources with exercises and to come up with exercises on my own. I will expand on the existing [Python notebook](../03/list_comp.ipynb) I created in day 3.

Google might be a good start:

- [https://www.google.com/search?q=list+comprehension+exercises](https://www.google.com/search?q=list+comprehension+exercises)

### GitHub Pages

To find (and follow) a resource related to creating pages on githib.io (AKA GitHub pages) and adapt my [existing bio](https://peter.beens.ca/) to it.

## Solution

### List Comprehension

[This discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/4d2yl7/i_need_list_comprehension_exercises_to_drill/) on Reddit had quite a few challenges that I was able to incorporate into my [notebook](../03/list_comp.ipynb).

### GitHub Pages

I successfully followed the directions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site) to create my new GitHub.io bio page at [https://pbeens.github.io](https://pbeens.github.io/).

## What I Learned

### List Comprehension

I am learning to get the hang of list comprehension. You just have to remember the basic format, which is:

```python
s = data_to_manipulate
[c for c in s if c equals or doesn't equal something]
```

View my updated Jupyter notebook of exercises [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fbmH9yDS5fzFcxEZMnUzmb3qCqGQoaEv).

### GitHub Pages

I learned that if you create a GitHub repository named `<username>.github.io` and put your content in the main README.md file that it becomes the website at that URL.

See mine [here](https://pbeens.github.io/)!

### Other Learning

I learned that Markdown doesn't like anything other than alphanumeric characters and hyphens in the headers if you want to create a table of contents. All of these were a no-go: 

> , | & ' " `
