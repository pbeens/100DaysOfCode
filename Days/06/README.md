1. To make maintaining this site more efficient.
1. To do more list comprehension lessons.
1. Finish the day 2 challenge!

## What I Learned

### Maintaining This Site

Maintaining this site was too time-consuming, with too much duplication of words and concepts, so I'm in the process of simplifying it. Namely, I'm reducing the sections on these pages from:

- Goal
- My Approach
- Solution, and
- What I Learned.

..to just:

- Goal(s), and
- What I Learned.

You'll notice Goal changed to Goal(s) because I often want to cover more than one topic in a day.

In addition, I'm greatly simplifying what I put on the main [README.md](../../README.md) file and just pointing the reader to these daily pages instead. The main page will have a very concise summary only.

### List Comprehension
