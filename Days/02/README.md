## Goal

Today's challenge comes from [Python Morsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com/exercises/cb8fbdd52cf14f8cb31df4f06343cccf/) (you must have a current subscription to access this link).

This is a bonus session for the [Day 1](Days/01-02/) challenge. I basically have to adapt the function so it works with _n_ sets of lists (instead of just two) in a list.

Note: the [test_add.py](test_add.py) file included in this folder comes as part of the challenge for testing my solution.

## What I Learned

### Day 2 Challenge

Sadly I wasn't able to complete this yet. I think I need to learn more about list comprehension to do this in a proper way. Yes, I can probably do it with nested loops but that's not very 'Pythonic'.

My function now only accepts two lists. This will have to be adapted to accept only one list of lists. 

### Other Learning

- Header entries can't include colons and be included in the TOC (at least using the process I'm using to create the TOC).
- I don't know list comprehension well enough.
