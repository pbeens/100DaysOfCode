## My Approach

My function now only accepts two lists. This will have to be adapted to accept only one list of lists. 

## Solution

_In progress!_

Sadly I wasn't able to complete this yet. I think I need to learn more about list comprehension to do this in a proper way. Yes, I can probably do it with nested loops but that's not very 'Pythonic'.

## What I Learned

* Header entries can't include colons and be included in the TOC (at least using the process I'm using to create the TOC).
* I don't know list comprehension well enough.
