  > I agree with the others that recommend sticking to one language. What is your reasoning for learn two languages at the same time? And why Java and JavaScript?

  Tip: I noticed you're using absolute paths for your filenames in your code. That will get you intro trouble if you run the code elsewhere. Use relative paths instead.
